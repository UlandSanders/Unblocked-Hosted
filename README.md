### About
Unblocked Hosted | Terms | Files | Logs

|Terms| This Repo Was Specifically Made To Unblock Really Popular Places, Some Include [Steam] [Spotify] And [Youtube], The Files Created Are Downloadable "For Offline Perposuse", But We Also Host A Website "Ran By Github" Where You Can Load Such Websites.

|Files| The Files Are Created To Run Specifically For The Program It Was Download/Copied For, And Cannot Be Edited Due To Its Such Mass Of A File, Altho We Cannot Stop You From Editing The Files, We Will Only Warn You That You May Damage What Was Copied From The Website.

|Logs| Dont Be Fooled By Logs, We Made Logs To Make Sure We Are In-line With Up-to-date Files, We Try Really Hard To Update Our Files So We Do NOT Ruin Your Day.

### Questions
What Program? | How Big? | Why Do This For Us?

|What Program| The Program We Use Is [httrack] A Popular Client Used To Copy Websites, To There Root, Altho We Suggest You Download Our BIG Files Here, As It Takes Time To Copy Websites, Trust Us From Experience "we have downloaded steam it took around 7 hours".

|How Big| Depends On The Website(s), For Example [Steam] Was Around 80G To Download From /root/, Which Took 7 Hours, But Small Websites Like Our Virtia VPN Website, Could Take Around 5-7 Minutes With Around 5mb Of Space Needed.

|Why Do This| We Did It For Many School Users, We Made A Custom Website With Changing Urls, Made From Github, So You Dont Need To Worry About Schools Blocking It, We Also Did It For Our Sakes "the creators" We Hate Schools Blocking Such Amazing Websites, So We Did Our Best Revenge!
